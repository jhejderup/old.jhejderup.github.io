>“If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in”
> - Edsgar Dijkstra

A famous quote made by the Dutch Computer Scientist Edsgar Dijkstra, the very same man who is famous for the shortest path algorithm taught in Universities around the world. Its from him and other famous Dutch Computer Scientist like Erik Meijer that has inspired me to pursue my master in the Netherlands in the conquest of expanding my knowledge and skill-set as a programmer. 

I am currently a M.Sc. Computer Science student at TU Delft who is passionate about programming techniques and most of all I enjoy social coding and sharing best practices. In the span of one year, I am slowly moving from my comfort zone in the Java world to become a functional-minded programmer in Scala!

The blog is intended to share my best-practices, tips&tricks and other things that is related to programming and university life.
